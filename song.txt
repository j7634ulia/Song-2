Eye of the hurricane
 Увеличить шрифт Уменьшить шрифт
People think that they can change most people
Once it rolls, it’s gonna crasВ центре урагана1
Sometimes I let it take me
Like a greased and vertical sled
I know the trick won’t break me
It’s all dancing in my head
It ain’t true
It’s easy to talk about change
Ain’t easy followin’ through
Once it starts, it has to finish
h
You know it finds its limit
Today’s heroes tomorrow’s tr
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be
You’re frozen
When your heart’s not open
Now there’s no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You’re frozen
When your heart’s not open
You’re so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You’re broken
When your heart’s not open
